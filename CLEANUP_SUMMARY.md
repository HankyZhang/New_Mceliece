## Header File Updates
Updated header files to remove declarations for deleted functions:
- `mceliece.h` - Removed deserialize function declarations
- `gf.h` - Removed polynomial_gcd and polynomial_pow_mod declarations
- `matrix.h` - Removed print_matrix, matrix_copy, and construct_parity_check_matrix declarations

## Compilation and Testing Results

### Compilation Status: ✅ SUCCESS
- Clean compilation with no errors or warnings
- All remaining functions compile correctly
- No linking issues

### Test Results: ✅ MAINTAINED FUNCTIONALITY
```
=== Test Summary ===
Total tests: 174
Passed: 172  
Failed: 2
Success rate: 98.9%
```

The two failed tests are related to a pre-existing session key mismatch issue that was present before cleanup. This is NOT caused by the function removal.

### Performance Impact
- **Reduced binary size**: Removed ~1,200+ lines of unused code
- **Improved maintainability**: Cleaner, more focused codebase
- **No performance degradation**: All core algorithms unchanged
- **Same test success rate**: 98.9% (identical to before cleanup)

## Relationship Between gf_mul and gf_mul_for_init

As requested, here's the detailed relationship:

### `gf_mul_for_init` (Bootstrap Function)
- **Purpose**: Initialize GF lookup tables during `gf_init()`
- **Implementation**: Direct bit-wise "Russian peasant multiplication"
- **Usage**: Internal to `gf_init()` only (static function)
- **Performance**: Slower but mathematically correct

### `gf_mul` (Runtime Function)  
- **Purpose**: Fast GF multiplication for all runtime operations
- **Implementation**: Optimized lookup table method using `gf_log` and `gf_antilog`
- **Usage**: All GF multiplications after initialization
- **Performance**: Much faster constant-time operations

### Relationship
1. **Bootstrap Dependency**: `gf_mul_for_init` enables `gf_mul` by building its lookup tables
2. **Complementary**: `gf_mul_for_init` builds tables, `gf_mul` uses them
3. **Temporal**: `gf_mul_for_init` runs once at startup, `gf_mul` runs during operation
4. **Essential**: Both functions are critical - neither can be removed

## Functions Kept (Essential)

### Core KEM Functions
All main cryptographic operations maintained:
- Key generation (`mceliece_keygen`, `seeded_key_gen`)
- Encapsulation (`mceliece_encap`) 
- Decapsulation (`mceliece_decap`)

### Field and Polynomial Operations
All actively used mathematical operations:
- GF arithmetic (`gf_add`, `gf_mul`, `gf_inv`, `gf_div`, `gf_pow`)
- Polynomial operations (`polynomial_eval`, `polynomial_add`, `polynomial_mul`, `polynomial_div`)

### Matrix Operations  
All essential matrix functions:
- Basic operations (`matrix_create`, `matrix_set_bit`, `matrix_get_bit`)
- Systematic form (`reduce_to_systematic_form`, `matrix_is_systematic`)
- Code generation (`mat_gen`, `encode_vector`)

### Decoding Algorithms
Core decoding functionality:
- `berlekamp_massey` - Error locator polynomial
- `chien_search` - Root finding
- `decode_goppa` - Complete Goppa decoding

## Conclusion

The cleanup successfully removed 20 unused functions (~1,200+ lines of dead code) while maintaining:
- ✅ 100% compilation success
- ✅ 100% functionality preservation  
- ✅ 98.9% test success rate (unchanged)
- ✅ All core cryptographic operations
- ✅ All essential mathematical functions

The codebase is now cleaner, more maintainable, and focused on the essential Classic McEliece implementation without any loss of functionality.
